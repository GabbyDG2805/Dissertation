# Dissertation
For my final-year Project in my Computer Science Degree, I decided to design &amp; develop a user-oriented website to help newer players learn the game “League of Legends”. The overall aim of this project was to produce a user-friendly website based on the design of League of Legends on which experienced players can submit advice to other players or aspiring players, creating a ‘knowledgebase’. The primary field of this project is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and therefore users and design were a priority throughout. This project is also relevant in the field of web development as the latest web-based programming standards have been used to code a fully functioning, responsive website. Primary and secondary research were carried out during this project, and many principles of HCI, UX Design, and Web Development were adhered to. This repository contains the code files of the produced website and instructions to run it, designs created, the WIP report and most importantly, the dissertation written detailing a literature review, methodologies, the design and development process, evaluation, conclusion, and reflective analysis. This is my proudest and most important piece of work produced for my degree, and a 1st class was achieved.
